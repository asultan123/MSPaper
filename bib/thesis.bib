  shorttitle   = {{ConViT}},
  abstract     = {Convolutional architectures have proven extremely successful for vision tasks. Their hard inductive biases enable sample-efficient learning, but come at the cost of a potentially lower performance ceiling. Vision Transformers ({ViTs}) rely on more flexible self-attention layers, and have recently outperformed {CNNs} for image classification. However, they require costly pre-training on large external datasets or distillation from pre-trained convolutional networks. In this paper, we ask the following question: is it possible to combine the strengths of these two architectures while avoiding their respective limitations? To this end, we introduce gated positional self-attention ({GPSA}), a form of positional self-attention which can be equipped with a ``soft" convolutional inductive bias. We initialise the {GPSA} layers to mimic the locality of convolutional layers, then give each attention head the freedom to escape locality by adjusting a gating parameter regulating the attention paid to position versus content information. The resulting convolutional-like {ViT} architecture, {ConViT}, outperforms the {DeiT} on {ImageNet}, while offering a much improved sample efficiency. We further investigate the role of locality in learning by first quantifying how it is encouraged in vanilla self-attention layers, then analysing how it is escaped in {GPSA} layers. We conclude by presenting various ablations to better understand the success of the {ConViT}. Our code and models are released publicly at https://github.com/facebookresearch/convit.},

However, such success greatly relies on costly computation resources, which hinders people with cheap devices from appreciating the advanced technology. In this paper, we propose Cross Stage Partial Network ({CSPNet}) to mitigate the problem that previous works require heavy inference computations from the network architecture perspective. We attribute the problem to the duplicate gradient information within network optimization. The proposed networks respect the variability of the gradients by integrating feature maps from the beginning and the end of a network stage, which, in our experiments, reduces computations by 20\% with equivalent or even superior accuracy on the {ImageNet} dataset, and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of {AP}50 on the {MS} {COCO} object detection dataset.

First, the co-scale mechanism maintains the integrity of Transformers' encoder branches at individual scales, while allowing representations learned at different scales to effectively communicate with each other; we design a series of serial and parallel blocks to realize the co-scale mechanism. Second, we devise a conv-attentional mechanism by realizing a relative position embedding formulation in the factorized attention module with an efficient convolution-like implementation. {CoaT} empowers image Transformers with enriched multi-scale and contextual modeling capabilities. On {ImageNet}, relatively small {CoaT} models attain superior classification results compared with similar-sized convolutional neural networks and image/vision Transformers. The effectiveness of {CoaT}'s backbone is also illustrated on object detection and instance segmentation, demonstrating its applicability to downstream computer vision tasks.},

However the optimization of image transformers has been little studied so far. In this work, we build and optimize deeper transformer networks for image classification. In particular, we investigate the interplay of architecture and optimization of such dedicated transformers. We make two transformers architecture changes that significantly improve the accuracy of deep transformers. This leads us to produce models whose performance does not saturate early with more depth, for instance we obtain 86.5\% top-1 accuracy on Imagenet when training with no external data, we thus attain the current {SOTA} with less {FLOPs} and parameters. Moreover, our best model establishes the new state of the art on Imagenet with Reassessed labels and Imagenet-V2 / match frequency, in the setting with no additional training data.

By just replacing the spatial convolutions with global self-attention in the final three bottleneck blocks of a {ResNet} and no other changes, our approach improves upon the baselines significantly on instance segmentation and object detection while also reducing the parameters, with minimal overhead in latency. Through the design of {BoTNet}, we also point out how {ResNet} bottleneck blocks with self-attention can be viewed as Transformer blocks. Without any bells and whistles, {BoTNet} achieves 44.4\% Mask {AP} and 49.7\% Box {AP} on the {COCO} Instance Segmentation benchmark using the Mask R-{CNN} framework; surpassing the previous best published single model and single scale results of {ResNeSt} evaluated on the {COCO} validation set. Finally, we present a simple adaptation of the {BoTNet} design for image classification, resulting in models that achieve a strong performance of 84.7\% top-1 accuracy on the {ImageNet} benchmark while being up to 1.64x faster in compute time than the popular {EfficientNet} models on {TPU}-v3 hardware.

On robustness test sets, it improves {ImageNet}-A top-1 accuracy from 61.0\% to 83.7\%, reduces {ImageNet}-C mean corruption error from 45.7 to 28.3, and reduces {ImageNet}-P mean flip rate from 27.8 to 12.2. Noisy Student Training extends the idea of self-training and distillation with the use of equal-or-larger student models and noise added to the student during learning. On {ImageNet}, we first train an {EfficientNet} model on labeled images and use it as a teacher to generate pseudo labels for 300M unlabeled images. We then train a larger {EfficientNet} as a student model on the combination of labeled and pseudo labeled images. We iterate this process by putting back the student as the teacher. During the learning of the student, we inject noise such as dropout, stochastic depth, and data augmentation via {RandAugment} to the student so that the student generalizes better than the teacher.

Here we present an opposite perspective: adversarial examples can be used to improve image recognition models if harnessed in the right manner. We propose {AdvProp}, an enhanced adversarial training scheme which treats adversarial examples as additional examples, to prevent overfitting. Key to our method is the usage of a separate auxiliary batch norm for adversarial examples, as they have different underlying distributions to normal examples. We show that {AdvProp} improves a wide range of models on various image recognition tasks and performs better when the models are bigger. For instance, by applying {AdvProp} to the latest {EfficientNet}-B7 [28] on {ImageNet}, we achieve significant improvements on {ImageNet} (+0.7\%), {ImageNet}-C (+6.5\%), {ImageNet}-A (+7.0\%), Stylized-{ImageNet} (+4.8\%).

By revealing the equivalence of the state-of-the-art Residual Network ({ResNet}) and Densely Convolutional Network ({DenseNet}) within the {HORNN} framework, we find that {ResNet} enables feature re-usage while {DenseNet} enables new features exploration which are both important for learning good representations. To enjoy the benefits from both path topologies, our proposed Dual Path Network shares common features while maintaining the flexibility to explore new features through dual path architectures. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, {ImagNet}-1k, Places365 and {PASCAL} {VOC}, clearly demonstrate superior performance of the proposed {DPN} over state-of-the-arts. In particular, on the {ImagNet}-1k dataset, a shallow {DPN} surpasses the best {ResNeXt}-101(64x4d) with 26\% smaller model size, 25\% less computational cost and 8\% lower memory consumption, and a deeper {DPN} ({DPN}-131) further pushes the state-of-the-art single model performance with about 2 times faster training speed.

Our reference vision transformer (86M parameters) achieves top-1 accuracy of 83.1\% (single-crop evaluation) on {ImageNet} with no external data. More importantly, we introduce a teacher-student strategy specific to transformers. It relies on a distillation token ensuring that the student learns from the teacher through attention. We show the interest of this token-based distillation, especially when using a convnet as a teacher. This leads us to report results competitive with convnets for both Imagenet (where we obtain up to 85.2\% accuracy) and when transferring to other tasks. We share our code and models.},

  abstract     = {Convolutional Neural Networks ({ConvNets}) are commonly developed at a fixed resource budget, and then scaled up for better accuracy if more resources are available. In this paper, we systematically study model scaling and identify that carefully balancing network depth, width, and resolution can lead to better performance. Based on this observation, we propose a new scaling method that uniformly scales all dimensions of depth/width/resolution using a simple yet highly effective compound coefficient. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on scaling up {MobileNets} and {ResNet}. To go even further, we use neural architecture search to design a new baseline network and scale it up to obtain a family of models, called {EfficientNets}, which achieve much better accuracy and efficiency than previous {ConvNets}. In particular, our {EfficientNet}-B7 achieves state-of-the-art 84.3\% top-1 accuracy on {ImageNet}, while being 8.4x smaller and 6.1x faster on inference than the best existing {ConvNet}. Our {EfficientNets} also transfer well and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on {CIFAR}-100 (91.7\%), Flowers (98.8\%), and 3 other transfer learning datasets, with an order of magnitude fewer parameters.

  abstract     = {This paper introduces {EfficientNetV}2, a new family of convolutional networks that have faster training speed and better parameter efficiency than previous models. To develop this family of models, we use a combination of training-aware neural architecture search and scaling, to jointly optimize training speed and parameter efficiency. The models were searched from the search space enriched with new ops such as Fused-{MBConv}. Our experiments show that {EfficientNetV}2 models train much faster than state-of-the-art models while being up to 6.8x smaller. Our training can be further sped up by progressively increasing the image size during training, but it often causes a drop in accuracy. To compensate for this accuracy drop, we propose to adaptively adjust regularization (e.g., dropout and data augmentation) as well, such that we can achieve both fast training and good accuracy. With progressive learning, our {EfficientNetV}2 significantly outperforms previous models on {ImageNet} and {CIFAR}/Cars/Flowers datasets. By pretraining on the same {ImageNet}21k, our {EfficientNetV}2 achieves 87.3\% top-1 accuracy on {ImageNet} {ILSVRC}2012, outperforming the recent {ViT} by 2.0\% accuracy while training 5x-11x faster using the same computing resources.

  abstract     = {Designing accurate and efficient {ConvNets} for mobile devices is challenging because the design space is combinatorially large. Due to this, previous neural architecture search ({NAS}) methods are computationally expensive. {ConvNet} architecture optimality depends on factors such as input resolution and target devices. However, existing approaches are too expensive for case-by-case redesigns. Also, previous work focuses primarily on reducing {FLOPs}, but {FLOP} count does not always reflect actual latency. To address these, we propose a differentiable neural architecture search ({DNAS}) framework that uses gradient-based methods to optimize {ConvNet} architectures, avoiding enumerating and training individual architectures separately as in previous methods. {FBNets}, a family of models discovered by {DNAS} surpass state-of-the-art models both designed manually and generated automatically. {FBNet}-B achieves 74.1\% top-1 accuracy on {ImageNet} with 295M {FLOPs} and 23.1 ms latency on a Samsung S8 phone, 2.4x smaller and 1.5x faster than {MobileNetV}2-1.3 with similar accuracy. Despite higher accuracy and lower latency than {MnasNet}, we estimate {FBNet}-B's search cost is 420x smaller than {MnasNet}'s, at only 216 {GPU}-hours. Searched for different resolutions and channel sizes, {FBNets} achieve 1.5\% to 6.4\% higher accuracy than {MobileNetV}2. The smallest {FBNet} achieves 50.2\% accuracy and 2.9 ms latency (345 frames per second) on a Samsung S8.

Even with the depth of features in a convolutional network, a layer in isolation is not enough: compounding and aggregating these representations improves inference of what and where. Architectural efforts are exploring many dimensions for network backbones, designing deeper or wider architectures, but how to best aggregate layers and blocks across a network deserves further attention. Although skip connections have been incorporated to combine layers, these connections have been "shallow" themselves, and only fuse by simple, one-step operations. We augment standard architectures with deeper aggregation to better fuse information across layers. Our deep layer aggregation structures iteratively and hierarchically merge the feature hierarchy to make networks with better accuracy and fewer parameters. Experiments across architectures and tasks show that deep layer aggregation improves recognition and resolution compared to existing branching and merging schemes.

Whereas traditional convolutional networks with L layers have L connections - one between each layer and its subsequent layer - our network has L(L+1)/2 direct connections. For each layer, the feature-maps of all preceding layers are used as inputs, and its own feature-maps are used as inputs into all subsequent layers. {DenseNets} have several compelling advantages: they alleviate the vanishing-gradient problem, strengthen feature propagation, encourage feature reuse, and substantially reduce the number of parameters. We evaluate our proposed architecture on four highly competitive object recognition benchmark tasks ({CIFAR}-10, {CIFAR}-100, {SVHN}, and {ImageNet}). {DenseNets} obtain significant improvements over the state-of-the-art on most of them, whilst requiring less computation to achieve high performance.

  abstract     = {Designing convolutional neural networks ({CNN}) for mobile devices is challenging because mobile models need to be small and fast, yet still accurate. Although significant efforts have been dedicated to design and improve mobile {CNNs} on all dimensions, it is very difficult to manually balance these trade-offs when there are so many architectural possibilities to consider. In this paper, we propose an automated mobile neural architecture search ({MNAS}) approach, which explicitly incorporate model latency into the main objective so that the search can identify a model that achieves a good trade-off between accuracy and latency. Unlike previous work, where latency is considered via another, often inaccurate proxy (e.g., {FLOPS}), our approach directly measures real-world inference latency by executing the model on mobile phones. To further strike the right balance between flexibility and search space size, we propose a novel factorized hierarchical search space that encourages layer diversity throughout the network. Experimental results show that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art mobile {CNN} models across multiple vision tasks. On the {ImageNet} classification task, our {MnasNet} achieves 75.2\% top-1 accuracy with 78ms latency on a Pixel phone, which is 1.8x faster than {MobileNetV}2 [29] with 0.5\% higher accuracy and 2.3x faster than {NASNet} [36] with 1.2\% higher accuracy.

To alleviate this complexity, we propose Single-Path {NAS}, a novel differentiable {NAS} method for designing hardware-efficient {ConvNets} in less than 4 hours. Our contributions are as follows: 1. Single-path search space: Compared to previous differentiable {NAS} methods, Single-Path {NAS} uses one single-path over-parameterized {ConvNet} to encode all architectural decisions with shared convolutional kernel parameters, hence drastically decreasing the number of trainable parameters and the search cost down to few epochs. 2. Hardware-efficient {ImageNet} classification: Single-Path {NAS} achieves 74.96\% top-1 accuracy on {ImageNet} with 79ms latency on a Pixel 1 phone, which is state-of-the-art accuracy compared to {NAS} methods with similar constraints ({\textless}80ms). 3. {NAS} efficiency: Single-Path {NAS} search cost is only 8 epochs (30 {TPU}-hours), which is up to 5,000x faster compared to prior work. 4. Reproducibility: Unlike all recent mobile-efficient {NAS} methods which only release pretrained models, we open-source our entire codebase at: https://github.com/dstamoulis/single-path-nas.},

The redundancy in feature maps is an important characteristic of those successful {CNNs}, but has rarely been investigated in neural architecture design. This paper proposes a novel Ghost module to generate more feature maps from cheap operations. Based on a set of intrinsic feature maps, we apply a series of linear transformations with cheap cost to generate many ghost feature maps that could fully reveal information underlying intrinsic features. The proposed Ghost module can be taken as a plug-and-play component to upgrade existing convolutional neural networks. Ghost bottlenecks are designed to stack Ghost modules, and then the lightweight {GhostNet} can be easily established. Experiments conducted on benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed Ghost module is an impressive alternative of convolution layers in baseline models, and our {GhostNet} can achieve higher recognition performance (e.g. \$75.7{\textbackslash}\%\$ top-1 accuracy) than {MobileNetV}3 with similar computational cost on the {ImageNet} {ILSVRC}-2012 classification dataset.

It is well-known in the neuroscience community that the receptive field size of visual cortical neurons are modulated by the stimulus, which has been rarely considered in constructing {CNNs}. We propose a dynamic selection mechanism in {CNNs} that allows each neuron to adaptively adjust its receptive field size based on multiple scales of input information. A building block called Selective Kernel ({SK}) unit is designed, in which multiple branches with different kernel sizes are fused using softmax attention that is guided by the information in these branches. Different attentions on these branches yield different sizes of the effective receptive fields of neurons in the fusion layer. Multiple {SK} units are stacked to a deep network termed Selective Kernel Networks ({SKNets}). On the {ImageNet} and {CIFAR} benchmarks, we empirically show that {SKNet} outperforms the existing state-of-the-art architectures with lower model complexity. Detailed analyses show that the neurons in {SKNet} can capture target objects with different scales, which verifies the capability of neurons for adaptively adjusting their receptive field sizes according to the input.

  abstract     = {Transformer is a new kind of neural architecture which encodes the input data as powerful features via the attention mechanism. Basically, the visual transformers first divide the input images into several local patches and then calculate both representations and their relationship. Since natural images are of high complexity with abundant detail and color information, the granularity of the patch dividing is not fine enough for excavating features of objects in different scales and locations. In this paper, we point out that the attention inside these local patches are also essential for building visual transformers with high performance and we explore a new architecture, namely, Transformer {iN} Transformer ({TNT}). Specifically, we regard the local patches (e.g., 16\${\textbackslash}times\$16) as "visual sentences" and present to further divide them into smaller patches (e.g., 4\${\textbackslash}times\$4) as "visual words". The attention of each word will be calculated with other words in the given visual sentence with negligible computational costs. Features of both words and sentences will be aggregated to enhance the representation ability. Experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed {TNT} architecture, e.g., we achieve an 81.5\% top-1 accuracy on the {ImageNet}, which is about 1.7\% higher than that of the state-of-the-art visual transformer with similar computational cost.

  abstract     = {Many deep learning models, developed in recent years, reach higher {ImageNet} accuracy than {ResNet}50, with fewer or comparable {FLOPS} count. While {FLOPs} are often seen as a proxy for network efficiency, when measuring actual {GPU} training and inference throughput, vanilla {ResNet}50 is usually significantly faster than its recent competitors, offering better throughput-accuracy trade-off. In this work, we introduce a series of architecture modifications that aim to boost neural networks' accuracy, while retaining their {GPU} training and inference efficiency. We first demonstrate and discuss the bottlenecks induced by {FLOPs}-optimizations. We then suggest alternative designs that better utilize {GPU} structure and assets. Finally, we introduce a new family of {GPU}-dedicated models, called {TResNet}, which achieve better accuracy and efficiency than previous {ConvNets}. Using a {TResNet} model, with similar {GPU} throughput to {ResNet}50, we reach 80.8 top-1 accuracy on {ImageNet}. Our {TResNet} models also transfer well and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on competitive single-label classification datasets such as Stanford cars (96.0\%), {CIFAR}-10 (99.0\%), {CIFAR}-100 (91.5\%) and Oxford-Flowers (99.1\%). They also perform well on multi-label classification and object detection tasks. Implementation is available at: https://github.com/{mrT}23/{TResNet}.},

Recent advances in backbone convolutional neural networks ({CNNs}) continually demonstrate stronger multi-scale representation ability, leading to consistent performance gains on a wide range of applications. However, most existing methods represent the multi-scale features in a layer-wise manner. In this paper, we propose a novel building block for {CNNs}, namely Res2Net, by constructing hierarchical residual-like connections within one single residual block. The Res2Net represents multi-scale features at a granular level and increases the range of receptive fields for each network layer. The proposed Res2Net block can be plugged into the state-of-the-art backbone {CNN} models, e.g., {ResNet}, {ResNeXt}, and {DLA}. We evaluate the Res2Net block on all these models and demonstrate consistent performance gains over baseline models on widely-used datasets, e.g., {CIFAR}-100 and {ImageNet}. Further ablation studies and experimental results on representative computer vision tasks, i.e., object detection, class activation mapping, and salient object detection, further verify the superiority of the Res2Net over the state-of-the-art baseline methods.

In this light, a depthwise separable convolution can be understood as an Inception module with a maximally large number of towers. This observation leads us to propose a novel deep convolutional neural network architecture inspired by Inception, where Inception modules have been replaced with depthwise separable convolutions. We show that this architecture, dubbed Xception, slightly outperforms Inception V3 on the {ImageNet} dataset (which Inception V3 was designed for), and significantly outperforms Inception V3 on a larger image classification dataset comprising 350 million images and 17,000 classes. Since the Xception architecture has the same number of parameters as Inception V3, the performance gains are not due to increased capacity but rather to a more efficient use of model parameters.},

The former networks are able to encode multi-scale contextual information by probing the incoming features with filters or pooling operations at multiple rates and multiple effective fields-of-view, while the latter networks can capture sharper object boundaries by gradually recovering the spatial information. In this work, we propose to combine the advantages from both methods. Specifically, our proposed model, {DeepLabv}3+, extends {DeepLabv}3 by adding a simple yet effective decoder module to refine the segmentation results especially along object boundaries. We further explore the Xception model and apply the depthwise separable convolution to both Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling and decoder modules, resulting in a faster and stronger encoder-decoder network.

The first stage is a convolutional neural network ({CNN}) that estimates 2D and 3D pose features along with identity assignments for all visible joints of all individuals.We contribute a new architecture for this {CNN}, called {SelecSLS} Net, that uses novel selective long and short range skip connections to improve the information flow allowing for a drastically faster network without compromising accuracy. In the second stage, a fully connected neural network turns the possibly partial (on account of occlusion) 2Dpose and 3Dpose features for each subject into a complete 3Dpose estimate per individual. The third stage applies space-time skeletal model fitting to the predicted 2D and 3D pose per subject to further reconcile the 2D and 3D pose, and enforce temporal coherence. Our method returns the full skeletal pose in joint angles for each subject. This is a further key distinction from previous work that do not produce joint angle results of a coherent skeleton in real time for multi-person scenes. The proposed system runs on consumer hardware at a previously unseen speed of more than 30 fps given 512x320 images as input while achieving state-of-the-art accuracy, which we will demonstrate on a range of challenging real-world scenes.},

  shorttitle   = {Swin Transformer},
  abstract     = {This paper presents a new vision Transformer, called Swin Transformer, that capably serves as a general-purpose backbone for computer vision. Challenges in adapting Transformer from language to vision arise from differences between the two domains, such as large variations in the scale of visual entities and the high resolution of pixels in images compared to words in text. To address these differences, we propose a hierarchical Transformer whose representation is computed with {\textbackslash}textbf\{S\}hifted {\textbackslash}textbf\{win\}dows. The shifted windowing scheme brings greater efficiency by limiting self-attention computation to non-overlapping local windows while also allowing for cross-window connection. This hierarchical architecture has the flexibility to model at various scales and has linear computational complexity with respect to image size. These qualities of Swin Transformer make it compatible with a broad range of vision tasks, including image classification (87.3 top-1 accuracy on {ImageNet}-1K) and dense prediction tasks such as object detection (58.7 box {AP} and 51.1 mask {AP} on {COCO} test-dev) and semantic segmentation (53.5 {mIoU} on {ADE}20K val). Its performance surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin of +2.7 box {AP} and +2.6 mask {AP} on {COCO}, and +3.2 {mIoU} on {ADE}20K, demonstrating the potential of Transformer-based models as vision backbones.

Since the transformer-based architecture has been innovative for computer vision modeling, the design convention towards an effective architecture has been less studied yet. From the successful design principles of {CNN}, we investigate the role of spatial dimension conversion and its effectiveness on transformer-based architecture. We particularly attend to the dimension reduction principle of {CNNs}; as the depth increases, a conventional {CNN} increases channel dimension and decreases spatial dimensions. We empirically show that such a spatial dimension reduction is beneficial to a transformer architecture as well, and propose a novel Pooling-based Vision Transformer ({PiT}) upon the original {ViT} model. We show that {PiT} achieves the improved model capability and generalization performance against {ViT}. Throughout the extensive experiments, we further show {PiT} outperforms the baseline on several tasks such as image classification, object detection, and robustness evaluation.

Our goal is to help advance the understanding of network design and discover design principles that generalize across settings. Instead of focusing on designing individual network instances, we design network design spaces that parametrize populations of networks. The overall process is analogous to classic manual design of networks, but elevated to the design space level. Using our methodology we explore the structure aspect of network design and arrive at a low-dimensional design space consisting of simple, regular networks that we call {RegNet}. The core insight of the {RegNet} parametrization is surprisingly simple: widths and depths of good networks can be explained by a quantized linear function. We analyze the {RegNet} design space and arrive at interesting findings that do not match the current practice of network design. The {RegNet} design space provides simple and fast networks that work well across a wide range of flop regimes. Under comparable training settings and flops, the {RegNet} models outperform the popular {EfficientNet} models while being up to 5x faster on {GPUs}.},

When trained with a modern training strategy using heavy data-augmentation and optionally distillation, it attains surprisingly good accuracy/complexity trade-offs on {ImageNet}.

We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the {ImageNet} dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than {VGG} nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the {ImageNet} test set. This result won the 1st place on the {ILSVRC} 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on {CIFAR}-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the {COCO} object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to {ILSVRC} \& {COCO} 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of {ImageNet} detection, {ImageNet} localization, {COCO} detection, and {COCO} segmentation.},

This strategy exposes a new dimension, which we call "cardinality" (the size of the set of transformations), as an essential factor in addition to the dimensions of depth and width. On the {ImageNet}-1K dataset, we empirically show that even under the restricted condition of maintaining complexity, increasing cardinality is able to improve classification accuracy. Moreover, increasing cardinality is more effective than going deeper or wider when we increase the capacity. Our models, named {ResNeXt}, are the foundations of our entry to the {ILSVRC} 2016 classification task in which we secured 2nd place. We further investigate {ResNeXt} on an {ImageNet}-5K set and the {COCO} detection set, also showing better results than its {ResNet} counterpart. The code and models are publicly available online.},

Yet, {ImageNet} is now nearly ten years old and is by modern standards "small". Even so, relatively little is known about the behavior of pretraining with datasets that are multiple orders of magnitude larger. The reasons are obvious: such datasets are difficult to collect and annotate. In this paper, we present a unique study of transfer learning with large convolutional networks trained to predict hashtags on billions of social media images. Our experiments demonstrate that training for large-scale hashtag prediction leads to excellent results. We show improvements on several image classification and object detection tasks, and report the highest {ImageNet}-1k single-crop, top-1 accuracy to date: 85.4\% (97.6\% top-5). We also perform extensive experiments that provide novel empirical data on the relationship between large-scale pretraining and transfer learning performance.},

  abstract     = {Recently, channel attention mechanism has demonstrated to offer great potential in improving the performance of deep convolutional neural networks ({CNNs}). However, most existing methods dedicate to developing more sophisticated attention modules for achieving better performance, which inevitably increase model complexity. To overcome the paradox of performance and complexity trade-off, this paper proposes an Efficient Channel Attention ({ECA}) module, which only involves a handful of parameters while bringing clear performance gain. By dissecting the channel attention module in {SENet}, we empirically show avoiding dimensionality reduction is important for learning channel attention, and appropriate cross-channel interaction can preserve performance while significantly decreasing model complexity. Therefore, we propose a local cross-channel interaction strategy without dimensionality reduction, which can be efficiently implemented via \$1D\$ convolution. Furthermore, we develop a method to adaptively select kernel size of \$1D\$ convolution, determining coverage of local cross-channel interaction. The proposed {ECA} module is efficient yet effective, e.g., the parameters and computations of our modules against backbone of {ResNet}50 are 80 vs. 24.37M and 4.7e-4 {GFLOPs} vs. 3.86 {GFLOPs}, respectively, and the performance boost is more than 2\% in terms of Top-1 accuracy. We extensively evaluate our {ECA} module on image classification, object detection and instance segmentation with backbones of {ResNets} and {MobileNetV}2. The experimental results show our module is more efficient while performing favorably against its counterparts.},

  abstract     = {Developing neural network image classification models often requires significant architecture engineering. In this paper, we study a method to learn the model architectures directly on the dataset of interest. As this approach is expensive when the dataset is large, we propose to search for an architectural building block on a small dataset and then transfer the block to a larger dataset. The key contribution of this work is the design of a new search space (the "{NASNet} search space") which enables transferability. In our experiments, we search for the best convolutional layer (or "cell") on the {CIFAR}-10 dataset and then apply this cell to the {ImageNet} dataset by stacking together more copies of this cell, each with their own parameters to design a convolutional architecture, named "{NASNet} architecture". We also introduce a new regularization technique called {ScheduledDropPath} that significantly improves generalization in the {NASNet} models. On {CIFAR}-10 itself, {NASNet} achieves 2.4\% error rate, which is state-of-the-art. On {ImageNet}, {NASNet} achieves, among the published works, state-of-the-art accuracy of 82.7\% top-1 and 96.2\% top-5 on {ImageNet}. Our model is 1.2\% better in top-1 accuracy than the best human-invented architectures while having 9 billion fewer {FLOPS} - a reduction of 28\% in computational demand from the previous state-of-the-art model. When evaluated at different levels of computational cost, accuracies of {NASNets} exceed those of the state-of-the-art human-designed models. For instance, a small version of {NASNet} also achieves 74\% top-1 accuracy, which is 3.1\% better than equivalently-sized, state-of-the-art models for mobile platforms. Finally, the learned features by {NASNet} used with the Faster-{RCNN} framework surpass state-of-the-art by 4.0\% achieving 43.1\% {mAP} on the {COCO} dataset.},

We also describe efficient ways of applying these mobile models to object detection in a novel framework we call {SSDLite}. Additionally, we demonstrate how to build mobile semantic segmentation models through a reduced form of {DeepLabv}3 which we call Mobile {DeepLabv}3. The {MobileNetV}2 architecture is based on an inverted residual structure where the input and output of the residual block are thin bottleneck layers opposite to traditional residual models which use expanded representations in the input an {MobileNetV}2 uses lightweight depthwise convolutions to filter features in the intermediate expansion layer. Additionally, we find that it is important to remove non-linearities in the narrow layers in order to maintain representational power. We demonstrate that this improves performance and provide an intuition that led to this design. Finally, our approach allows decoupling of the input/output domains from the expressiveness of the transformation, which provides a convenient framework for further analysis. We measure our performance on Imagenet classification, {COCO} object detection, {VOC} image segmentation.

Although many studies are devoted to optimizing the structure of deep models for efficient inference, most of them do not leverage the architecture of {\textbackslash}textbf\{modern {GPU}\} for fast inference, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this issue, we propose a general principle for designing {GPU}-efficient networks based on extensive empirical studies. This design principle enables us to search for {GPU}-efficient network structures effectively by a simple and lightweight method as opposed to most Neural Architecture Search ({NAS}) methods that are complicated and computationally expensive. Based on the proposed framework, we design a family of {GPU}-Efficient Networks, or {GENets} in short. We did extensive evaluations on multiple {GPU} platforms and inference engines. While achieving \${\textbackslash}geq 81.3{\textbackslash}\%\$ top-1 accuracy on {ImageNet}, {GENet} is up to \$6.4\$ times faster than {EfficienNet} on {GPU}. It also outperforms most state-of-the-art models that are more efficient than {EfficientNet} in high precision regimes.

  abstract     = {Self-attention has the promise of improving computer vision systems due to parameter-independent scaling of receptive fields and content-dependent interactions, in contrast to parameter-dependent scaling and content-independent interactions of convolutions. Self-attention models have recently been shown to have encouraging improvements on accuracy-parameter trade-offs compared to baseline convolutional models such as {ResNet}-50. In this work, we aim to develop self-attention models that can outperform not just the canonical baseline models, but even the high-performing convolutional models. We propose two extensions to self-attention that, in conjunction with a more efficient implementation of self-attention, improve the speed, memory usage, and accuracy of these models. We leverage these improvements to develop a new self-attention model family, {HaloNets}, which reach state-of-the-art accuracies on the parameter-limited setting of the {ImageNet} classification benchmark. In preliminary transfer learning experiments, we find that {HaloNet} models outperform much larger models and have better inference performance. On harder tasks such as object detection and instance segmentation, our simple local self-attention and convolutional hybrids show improvements over very strong baselines. These results mark another step in demonstrating the efficacy of self-attention models on settings traditionally dominated by convolutional models.},

In this work we resolve this by introducing Hard Constrained {diffeRentiable} {NAS} ({HardCoRe}-{NAS}), that is based on an accurate formulation of the expected resource requirement and a scalable search method that satisfies the hard constraint throughout the search.

  abstract     = {High-resolution representations are essential for position-sensitive vision problems, such as human pose estimation, semantic segmentation, and object detection. Existing state-of-the-art frameworks first encode the input image as a low-resolution representation through a subnetwork that is formed by connecting high-to-low resolution convolutions {\textbackslash}emph\{in series\} (e.g., {ResNet}, {VGGNet}), and then recover the high-resolution representation from the encoded low-resolution representation. Instead, our proposed network, named as High-Resolution Network ({HRNet}), maintains high-resolution representations through the whole process. There are two key characteristics: (i) Connect the high-to-low resolution convolution streams {\textbackslash}emph\{in parallel\}; (ii) Repeatedly exchange the information across resolutions. The benefit is that the resulting representation is semantically richer and spatially more precise. We show the superiority of the proposed {HRNet} in a wide range of applications, including human pose estimation, semantic segmentation, and object detection, suggesting that the {HRNet} is a stronger backbone for computer vision problems.

One example is the Inception architecture that has been shown to achieve very good performance at relatively low computational cost. Recently, the introduction of residual connections in conjunction with a more traditional architecture has yielded state-of-the-art performance in the 2015 {ILSVRC} challenge; its performance was similar to the latest generation Inception-v3 network. This raises the question of whether there are any benefit in combining the Inception architecture with residual connections. Here we give clear empirical evidence that training with residual connections accelerates the training of Inception networks significantly. There is also some evidence of residual Inception networks outperforming similarly expensive Inception networks without residual connections by a thin margin. We also present several new streamlined architectures for both residual and non-residual Inception networks. These variations improve the single-frame recognition performance on the {ILSVRC} 2012 classification task significantly. We further demonstrate how proper activation scaling stabilizes the training of very wide residual Inception networks. With an ensemble of three residual and one Inception-v4, we achieve 3.08 percent top-5 error on the test set of the {ImageNet} classification ({CLS}) challenge},

Here we explore ways to scale up networks in ways that aim at utilizing the added computation as efficiently as possible by suitably factorized convolutions and aggressive regularization. We benchmark our methods on the {ILSVRC} 2012 classification challenge validation set demonstrate substantial gains over the state of the art: 21.2\% top-1 and 5.6\% top-5 error for single frame evaluation using a network with a computational cost of 5 billion multiply-adds per inference and with using less than 25 million parameters.

Similar to linear attention, lambda layers bypass expensive attention maps, but in contrast, they model both content and position-based interactions which enables their application to large structured inputs such as images. The resulting neural network architectures, {LambdaNetworks}, significantly outperform their convolutional and attentional counterparts on {ImageNet} classification, {COCO} object detection and {COCO} instance segmentation, while being more computationally efficient. Additionally, we design {LambdaResNets}, a family of hybrid architectures across different scales, that considerably improves the speed-accuracy tradeoff of image classification models. {LambdaResNets} reach excellent accuracies on {ImageNet} while being 3.2 - 4.4x faster than the popular {EfficientNets} on modern machine learning accelerators.

Our work revisits the canonical {ResNet} (He et al., 2015) and studies these three aspects in an effort to disentangle them. Perhaps surprisingly, we find that training and scaling strategies may matter more than architectural changes, and further, that the resulting {ResNets} match recent state-of-the-art models. We show that the best performing scaling strategy depends on the training regime and offer two new scaling strategies: (1) scale model depth in regimes where overfitting can occur (width scaling is preferable otherwise); (2) increase image resolution more slowly than previously recommended (Tan \& Le, 2019). Using improved training and scaling strategies, we design a family of {ResNet} architectures, {ResNet}-{RS}, which are 1.7x - 2.7x faster than {EfficientNets} on {TPUs}, while achieving similar accuracies on {ImageNet}. In a large-scale semi-supervised learning setup, {ResNet}-{RS} achieves 86.2\% top-1 {ImageNet} accuracy, while being 4.7x faster than {EfficientNet} {NoisyStudent}. The training techniques improve transfer performance on a suite of downstream tasks (rivaling state-of-the-art self-supervised algorithms) and extend to video classification on Kinetics-400.

In this paper, we study an effective channel dimension configuration towards better performance than the convention. To this end, we empirically study how to design a single layer properly by analyzing the rank of the output feature. We then investigate the channel configuration of a model by searching network architectures concerning the channel configuration under the computational cost restriction. Based on the investigation, we propose a simple yet effective channel configuration that can be parameterized by the layer index.
