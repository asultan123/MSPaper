Arch works great for some networks but not for others due to poor mapping/ insufficient resources
repeat overall metrics
need to exploit other forms of concurrency using loop construct and handle layers that poorly map like depthwise
need to define interaction between SAMs and Dram and handle data transformations on the fly
Incorporate more layers like activation and batch norm on-chip
